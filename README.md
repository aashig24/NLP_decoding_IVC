*Decoding Scriptures of Indus Valley Civilization*
This project aims to decode and understand the ancient Harappan (Indus Valley Civilization) scripts using NLP and data processing techniques. The primary objective is to identify and analyze symbols and texts to reconstruct potential meanings or linguistic patterns from these artifacts.

*8Project Overview*
The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the earliest civilizations in history, left behind a large collection of symbols that remain largely undeciphered. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and image processing to preprocess, classify, and analyze these symbols, in hopes of uncovering linguistic patterns that may help decode the language.
